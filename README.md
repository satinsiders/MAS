# MAS â€“ Multi-Agent Bootstrap


![CI](https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/virtual-department/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
MAS ("virtual department") aims to orchestrate a hierarchy of agents capable of collaborating on real-world tasks. This repository contains the foundational code and infrastructure for the project.

## Project Goal
Provide a modular platform where new functional templates can plug in quickly while maintaining governance and cost controls.

## Four-Layer Agent Architecture

The platform is organized into a four-layer hierarchy of agents. Detailed design documentation will be added in a future release.
